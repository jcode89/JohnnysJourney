    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Jonathan Colon, born and raised in New York and a lover of a knowledge.
I went to school for Political Science, and even graduated with a degree in that
major, but along the way I found I love programming just as much as Political
Science. I started out with C++ but switched to Python so I could get a better
understanding of computer science.
This choice was nothing but beneficial. I have learned so much, and continue to learn
so much everyday while programming in Python. However, I don't want to limit myself to one
language. Thus, I started learning C and Clojure as well. It isn't always easy learning a
new language, but once you get a grasp of the syntax, the possibilities of what you
can create seem endless. That is what I love most about programming, the endless possibilities.</p>
<p>My goal is to become a professional developer, but along the way I am going to post about my journey.
I want to share my experiences with the world, and this seems the best way to do that.</p>
